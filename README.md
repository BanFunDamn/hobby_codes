# About This Repository

# Description of Each Program

## AdjustHtml
- This program make the html code more clean by adjusting the indent and dividing the lines to html-tag line and content line.
- Sometimes, the html code of web site got stacked and don't you feel nervous to read that code?<br>This might help you to read! (Of course this beyonds to the feeling of each person)

## AnnounceUpdate
- By giving an URL of news site to this program, you could get notifications if there are new informations in that site.
- But the function is adjusted for each site, so this is still not convenience so much...

## BrowserBookmark
- This program creates a file that contains the list of bookmark, but the words got encrypted (in very easy way) so other people can't see what page you got saved.
- Don't you sometimes wanna hide even the name of the web site from others? (e.g. Online store for adult things)<br>This is to save but hide those bookmarks! (Don't feel whenever be safe! Others can easily see when you opened the page in brower! <- Nobody should misunderstand this but I just wanted to make sure)
